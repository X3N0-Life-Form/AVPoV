    Operation Blank Rock could not proceed as planned due to detection by Shivan forces. At 0145, a group of Manticore fighters spotted the GTD Streaker and escaped before they could be shot down. 22 seconds after the manticores' departure, a large Shivan force ambushed the Streaker, causing significant dmage to the destroyer forcing it to retreat to Allied controlled space.


Analysis:

    The speed at which the Shivans deployed their fleet is a bit worrying, as it denotes that their ships were ready to jump in before the manticores had even arrived, suggesting that the Shivans are fully aware of the objective of our operations and determined to shut us down. This also suggest that despite the utterly alien nature of the Shivans and Shivan thinking, they are capable of analysing our behavior and draw seemingly correct conclusions. This does not bode well for the future of Special Operations against the Shivans in the nebula, and I must again request further coordination with regular fleet elements for the upcoming operations Equinox and Wind Bash.
