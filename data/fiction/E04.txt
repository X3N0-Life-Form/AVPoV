    A brilliant failure. The Pharaoh, Black Mamba, Carthage, remote beam cannons and escort were sitting at the node. Command estimated that the Sathanas was equipped with four forward-facing, possibly long range, destroyer-grade beam weapons. Command was wrong. The plan was to hit the Juggernaught at long range, using AWACS to lock on beyond standard range, and retreat gradually as each warship took damage.

    We scored a few hits alright, except that, unlike the Colossus, the Sathanas is apparently equipped with juggernaught-grade beam weapons. We barely had time to escape. Command is moving the Colossus to the other side of node, but with these four beams operational, I doubt it stands much of a chance. I guess they are going to send a few bombers on a suicide run against the forward beams, plus a few warships to attempt to slow down the Juggernaught.

    If they fail, stopping the Destroyers will be extremely difficult this time. They can't take our homeworlds away anymore, but we still have ground and space-based colonies to call home.
