    We finally managed to kill that sucker. We have lost quite a few warships in the process, not to mention some of the pilots involved in the attack. May our Ancestors watch over the bomber pilots that defanged the Vampire. I hear that this ship had one of the highest killcount among Shivan warships. Anyway, we lost two power nodes during the fight, which fried the large beam emitters, which means I am being shifted to anti-fighter beam duty while damage control attempts to stabilize the power grid and replace the beam emitters. I would have prefered to be sent to one of the cruiser-caliber beams. Apius's aim has always been a bit off.

    We are still sitting at the node until the reinforcements arrive from Capella. A big juicy target for any Shivan remaining in system. Without our main beams, capships are going to be a problem, but nothing our pilots can't handle.
