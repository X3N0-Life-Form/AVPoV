    Sathanas. That's the name of the Shivan flagship this time. The good news is, us cruisers won't be deployed against it, that's a destroyer or corvette's job. The bad news is, I'm not sure even these should be deployed against such an gigantic warship. I hear Command already has a plan or two to deal with that threat. "Command always has a plan, just hope it's a good one". It doesn't seem that funny when the ship you're in is under hornet fire. Right now, it seems downright grim.

    In any case, as the captain says "Hope for the Best, prepare for the worst". I just hope we know what the worst is.
