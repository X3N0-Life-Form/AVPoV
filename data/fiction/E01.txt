    We've just finished modifying cockpits to accomodate Vasudan pilots. The Vasudans themselves are scheduled to arrive later today. I'm curious to see what is going to come out of all these officer exchange programs. Terran and Vasudan flying philosophy have always been significantly different, especially at the twilight of the Terran-Vasudan War, where they countered the GTA's sturdy-but-slow fighters with agile-but-fragile fighters.

    Things haven't changed much in that regard: from what I heard, the Serapis is a dream to fly but lasts less than a second under flak fire. I wonder how they manage to put so many missiles into the Tauret though. Well, at least they'll be better at avoiding enemy fire, which likely means less work for us down here.

	Anyway, I've heard things calmed down a bit for you guys. Does that mean your request for leave has a chance of being granted? It would be nice if we could sync up our breaks. I haven't seen you and James together since Bosch started his rebellion. Me and Safira are putting all plans on hold until this Shivan situation blows over... We were thinking about moving to either Delta Serpentis or Alpha Centauri, to be closer to home. Hope you are well, and watch those bombs.
