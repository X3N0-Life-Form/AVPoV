    It's gone. The Shivans spaced her. Just as we were about to jump out of this forsaken system, a destroyer slipped through our forces and ran straight up to the node to engage the Olympus Shadow. How flippin' fair is that? Why the hell were the Shivans so determined to kill her off? They lost goodness knows how many ships to pull that off, including the destroyer that delivered the killing blow. How can it be worth the effort? Are they insane? did they do that just to spite us, or as a show of force? "Yeah, we've got so many ships we're throwing them away just to kill one of your guys."

    In the meantime, the rumor mill is going crazy. I've heard something about new Sathanas-class vessels popping up in the nebula, about dozens of new destroyers and hundreds of cruisers moving towards Gamma Drax... Some guy the other day said he saw a spec ops group escorting a pair of Shivan ships through the node, was told everything was classified but spilled the beans anyway.

    Just what the hell is going on? The Shivans always relied on command ships to coordinate their operations. Destroy one, it takes days for its lackeys to start being coherent again. Yet, when the Colossus killed the Sathanas, the biggest and meanest warship since the Lucifer, they barely bat an eye. I am not quite sure what this is supposed to mean, but it can't be good.

    Half our pilots are being transefered to the GTD Normandy, the rest are split between 3rd fleet's Aquitaine and Messana. The Vasudan pilots are returning to their original base of operation. Some of them were really good. As in "Special Operations" good. The Neo Terran Front was a bunch of fools. There is no way either of our species can survive on their own, not against the Destroyers.

    I really hope none of these rumors are true...
