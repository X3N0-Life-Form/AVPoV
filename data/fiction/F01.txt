    It's gone. The Shivans spaced her. Just as we were about to jump out of this forsaken system, a destroyer slipped through our forces just to engage the Olympus Shadow. Meanwhile, in the nebula, the latest rumor says another Sathanas appeared and blasted a Vasudan destroyer to bits.

    Just what the hell is going on? The Shivans always relied on command ships to coordinate their operations. Destroy one, and everything under its command loses all its initiative and tactical sense. Yet, when the Colossus killed the Sathanas, the biggest and meanest warship since the Lucifer, they barely bat an eye. I am not quite sure what this is supposed to mean, but it can't be good.

    Half our pilots are being transefered to the GTD Normandy, the rest are split between 3rd fleet's Aquitaine and Messana. The Vasudan pilots are returning to their original base of operation. Some of them were really good. As in "Special Operations" good. The Neo Terran Front was a bunch of fools. There is no way either of our species can survive on their own, not against the Destroyers.

    I really hope these "new Sathanas" rumors are just that, and nothing else...
