    The Neo Terran Front's end draws near. After 18 months of terror and slaughter, the bastards are finally going down. The Colossus just arrived in system, 3 out of 5 assaults on rallying points have been a complete success. The Black Mamba itself delivered the killing blow to the NTCv J.E.Johnson and NTCv Dauntless. I wanted to let them burn a bit, but Command wanted the fight over as quickly as possible. No offence to 3rd Fleet Terran Command, but getting some more retribution would have done wonders to the moral.

    Deep down I didn't expect any Terran to understand. They aren't the ones whose civilians have been slaughtered over the past 18 months. Not systematically slaughtered at least, the NTF had little consideration for Terran civilians as well. They didn't nuke any Terran city, but Terrans present during the occupation of Cygnus Prime and Centaurus Secundus were considered traitors and executed.

    I always wonder how, given the Terrans' warmongering attitude, they didn't end up nuking themselves before they started colonizing the stars. In all fairness, we DO have an history of having particularly destructive wars during the establishment of the Empire of Vasuda, which only really ceased with the Parliamentary Vasudan Empire. "The fires burn brighter on Vasuda, but they burn longer on Terra" as Ehep'Hies once he had the chance to study Terran history. It's funny how little we knew about each other's culture after 14 years of war.
