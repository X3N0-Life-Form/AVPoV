 - CUT THAT PART OUT???[size=8]1st gen barely had any SEXPs beyond arrival/departure cues most of which were mission-time based, 2nd gen had event chains, waypoints, 3rd gen were more scripted and had new weapons, armor and AI, and some abuse of the fire-beam SEXP, 4th was about using variables and conditional SEXPs to better react to player actions, 5th was about dynamic waypoints, new ships, SSM strikes and abuse of the weapon-create SEXP, while the 6th will probably be about making use of lua scripts[/size]???END CUT
