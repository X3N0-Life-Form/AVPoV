Greeting, fellow modders


The final part of my ship variant framework is a script capable of assigning a variant to any number of ships in a mission with a single lua call. The script relies on the ship variant infrastructure, as well as another config table which specifies which variant is used by which ships within a certain number of categories. The ships are grouped by table category.

Source code is available [url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/X3N0-Life-Form/AVPoV/master/data/scripts/shipVariantMissionWide.lua]here[/url].

Put [i]shipVariantMissionWide.lua[/i] in data/scripts.

In data/tables/init-sct.tbm, under [color=green]#Conditional Hooks[/color]:
[code]
$On Game Init: [[shipVariantMissionWide.lua]]
[/code]

Let's say you have a bunch of recurring baddies called 'Serkr Team'. You've made Serkr variants for each of their ship classes in [i]ship_variants.tbl[/i], so now you'll want to add these to you mission-wide variant table:

In data/config/ship_variants_mission_wide.tbl:
[code]
#Serkr

$Name:		Marcus Glaive
$Variant:	Serkr

$Name:		Hydra
$Variant:	Serkr

$Name:		Pilum
$Variant:	Serkr

#End
[/code]

In FRED, for missions that use Serkr Team:
[code]
( script-eval-block
	"setShipVariants("
	"'Serkr')"
)
[/code]

You can also assign a variant to a "wing" of ships by adding the [font=courier]+Wing:[/font] + a number sub-attribute to the [font=courier]$Variant:[/font] attribute, the script will then assign the variant to every ship bearing the same name + a number, for instance:
[code]
#Mission 10-hard
; assigns the "Morning-Maxim" variant to sentry guns 1 through 12
$Name:		Sentry Gun
$Variant:	Morning-Maxim
	+Wing:	12

#End

#Mission 10-easy

; assigns the "PromR-Subach" variant to sentry guns 1 through 8
$Name:		Sentry Gun
$Variant:	PromR-Subach
	+Wing:	8

#End
[/code]


I am open to suggestions, remarks, questions regarding both this script and the way it is presented in this thread [size=8pt](in other words: I'm not sure if I'm explaining things properly here)[/size].
