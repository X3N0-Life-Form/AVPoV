A Vasudan Point of View
=======================
=======================

Freespace 2 modpack + campaign

Setting
=======
This is a Capella era campaign, whose events are somewhat parallel to the main Freespace 2 campaign.
You play as a Vasudan pilot fighting to contain the Shivan incursion in the nebula and Gamma Draconis.


Differences between AVPoV & FS2
===============================
There is a certain number of differences between the FS2 gameplay, and how things work in AVPoV.
As a result, the main campaign has received some minor edits to be more in line with the rest of AVPoV.

AI and improved Shivan agility
------------------------------
Like any modern mod, AVPoV takes advantage of FSO's improved AI features. In addition, Shivan fighters and
bombers have been altered to be able to glide (like in Vassago's Dirge), with FS2-era fighters - plus Dragons
& Seraphims, having 6 degrees of freedom (ie, reverse + side + up/down thrust).


Armor and damage types
----------------------
In general, Shivan strike crafts and capital ship are more resistant to the Alliance's lighter weapon -
aside from the Kayser, while Shivan weapons are all around more deadly.

Ship variants
-------------
Some capital ships (particularily Shivan vessels) come up in different "variants" of varying turret loadout,
armor type or hit points meant to fulfil certain roles better than others, without needing a new specialized
asset. For exemple, the standard Rakshasa variant come with 4 SRed beams, while another variant trades two
of these for multi turrets (see "New Weapons" below). The file *ship_variants.txt* lists the different variants
for each vessel (may contain mild spoilers).

New weapons
-----------
Both Alliance and Shivan arsenal have been expanded a bit:
  - There are now several Vasudan-exclusive weapons.
  - Alliance bombers, myrmidons, taurets and serapis have access to a pair of ammo-based primaries.
  - Alliance bombers and myrmidons are able to carry a short range swarmer bomb.
  - New GTVA capital ship weapons:
    * Wraith: long range banshee variant, usually replace green blob turrets on older warships.
    * Mass Driver: anti-hull weapon, provides additional anti-ship firepower.
    * Medium-grade direct fire beam weapons: found on some of the newer warships.
    * Ship-to-ship torpedo systems.
    * [CLASSIFIED]
  - Shivans primary weapons and laser turrets come with an upgraded variant, used in the later stages of the campaign.
  - A corvette-grade direct fire beam is now mounted on Shivan corvettes and destroyers.
  - Shivan multi-shot turret: fires in bursts, dangerous vs bombers and big ships.
  - New Shivan strike craft & sentry gun weapons:
    * Sniper gun: long range, high kinetic effect, low shield penetration.
    * Scatter gun & Light scatter gun: close range, fast firing shotgun.
    * Heavy anticap laser: an offshoot of the upgraded mega laser.
    * Large Cannon: powerful anti-ship primary found on Taurvi bombers.
    * Flak Weapon: found on Taurvis and Seraphims, fires multiple shots at once.
    * Swarmer bombs: fired at long range, these are designed to saturate the target's point defences (source: the UEF Warhammer torpedo from Blue Planet)
  - Subspace Missile strikes:
    * In the later parts of the game, Shivans will start using subspace missiles.
    * These can come in various forms and means:  the traditional TAG then strike, local SSMs, or using spotter ships.
    * Different alarm sounds will allow you to identify incoming non-local strikes.

New ships
---------
Most of the "new" GTVA warships are supposed to be cutting/bleeding edge assets that are only beginning to enter
active duty.
* Vasudan capital ships:
  - GVC Mentu Enforcer: More fragile than a regular *Mentu*, it carries a powerful beam cannon.
  - GVC Newet: Has a terrifying array of anti-fighter weapons, but lack the anti-capital punch of the *Enforcer*
  - GVGb Hemsut: Torpedo gunboat.
  - GVCv Selket (asset status pending): Vasudan equivalent to the Sparta (see below), but closer to enter active duty.
* Vasudan fighters:
  - GVB Hathor: 6 DoF capable bomber, an improvement upon the *Sekhmet*.
  - GVF Nhu: Small, tough and agile, but lacks the raw firepower of the *Erinyes* and *Ares*, its Terran counterparts.
  - GVF Serapis Elite: 6 DoF capable variant of the *Serapis*, has more armor/shield, and a wider weapon compatibility.
* Terran capital ships:
  - GTGb Cretheus: Flak gunboat, has a pair of mass driver turrets for anti-ship duty.
  - GTCv Sparta: Powerful bleeding edge warship. Boasts formidable anti-capital firepower.
* Shivan capital ships:
  - SGb Asura: Powerful, but fragile gunboat.
