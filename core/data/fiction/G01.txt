    This is it. The end of the line. Capella went supernova, so we all jumped to avoid the shockwave. We have been in subspace for half an hour so far, as if we were making an inter-system jump. We were in the same corridor as the Streaker for some reason, and we could detect a Sathanas far away.

    The Streaker's C.O. told us to land in order to grab fresh fighters. Said fighters turned out to be Terran and Vasudan adapted Shivan strikecrafts. I don't know where we are going to jump out, but I doubt fancy fighters are going to save us. We are just preparing for our final stand.

    The Streaker is a Special Operations Destroyer. Some of the deck crew told me they had been conducting operations in the nebula since the discovery of the NTC Trinity by the Aquitaine. When the first Sathanas forced the fleet out of the nebula, they stayed behind to attempt to slow down the Juggernaught - and failed: the Sathanas arrived unharmed in Gamma Draconis.

    I better get going, we are probably going to come out of subspace soon. May our Ancestors watch over us.
