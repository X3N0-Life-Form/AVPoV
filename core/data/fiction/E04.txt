    A brilliant failure. The Pharaoh, Black Mamba, Carthage, remote beam cannons platforms and escort were sitting at the node. Command estimated that the Sathanas was equipped with four forward-facing, possibly long range, destroyer-grade beam weapons. Command was wrong. The plan was to hit the Juggernaut at long range, using AWACS to lock on beyond standard range, and retreat gradually as each warship took damage.

    We scored a few hits alright, except that, unlike the Colossus, the Sathanas is apparently equipped with something a bit stronger than destroyer-grade beam weapons. We barely had time to escape. Command is moving the Colossus to the other side of node, but with these four beams operational, I doubt it stands much of a chance. My guess is that they are going to send a bunch of poor schmucks on a suicide run to disable these beams, possibly with a few warships thrown in for good measure.

    If they fail, stopping Them is going to be ... difficult this time. No reactors to blow up in subspace, right? They can't take our homeworlds away anymore, but we still have ground and space-based colonies to call home.
