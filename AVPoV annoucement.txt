Let me [s]present[s/] announce to you, an exciting upcoming mod campaign called :

[size=12][b]So what's this about?[/b][/size]
This is a little project I've been working on for a long, long time - since I made my baby steps in FRED, basically, so the project technically started circa 2008-2009. The original goal was to produce a campaign similar in style to Retail FS2, but flying Vasudan crafts. Like a lot of rookie modders, I planned for way too many missions, assuming my momentum would keep steady throughout the year - although past experiences in mission/campaign design in various other games should have been a clue that it wouldn't be the case.

As time went by, I picked up a few more modding skill, which usually ushered in a new generation of missions and overhauls to existing missions - [size=8]1st gen barely had any SEXPs beyond arrival/departure cues most of which were mission-time based, 2nd gen had event chains, waypoints, 3rd gen were more scripted and had new weapons, armor and AI, and some abuse of the fire-beam SEXP, 4th was about using variables and conditional SEXPs to better react to player actions, 5th was about dynamic waypoints, new ships, SSM strikes and abuse of the weapon-create SEXP, while the 6th will probably be about making use of lua scripts[/size]. So basically the thing went from "bunch of loosely related missions to learn the basics of FREDing" to "make my own take of FS2" to "hey, modding is fun, let's find some cool things to do", which means that the final product has quite a few deviations from the stock FS2 gameplay & balance.

Fortunately, the campaign is structured around mostly unrelated story arcs, which mean that I don't actually [i]need[/i] the finish the whole 27-something missions to have something release worthy, and the more experimental stuff is mostly confined to the later parts of the campaign.

[size=12][b]Sounds interesting, any ETA on release ?[/b][/size]
Hopefully, sometimes within the next 5 years. Failing that, sometimes within the next decade.

[size=12][b]So it's a Vasudan-centric campaign, what's your take on Vasudanity ? How is it different from Humanity ? What parts of their canon portrayal did you expand on ?[/b][/size]
Nothing ground breaking really, since story-wise I'm mostly emulating Retail's approach and portrayal, meaning throwing in the occasional prideful remark, or pseudo-philosophic or somewhat poetic sounding statement, that kind of thing. Outside of raw story writing, I've given the Vasudan some endgame gear  of their own,
