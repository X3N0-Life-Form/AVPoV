A Vasudan Point of View
=======================
=======================

Freespace 2 modpack + campaign

Setting
=======
This is a Capella-era campaign, whose events are somewhat parallel to the main Freespace 2 campaign.
You play as a Vasudan pilot fighting to contain the Shivan incursion in the nebula and Gamma Draconis.


Differences between AVPoV & FS2
===============================
There is a certain number of differences between the retail FS2 gameplay, and how things work in AVPoV.
As a result, the main campaign has received some minor edits for both balancing purposes and to be more
in line with the rest of AVPoV.

AI and improved Shivan agility
------------------------------
AVPoV takes advantage of FSO's improved AI features to create a more intense experience. Thanks to that,
Shivan fighters and bombers now sport glide capability - akin to what is seen in Vassago's Dirge), with
more "advanced" crafts (read : FS2-era fighters - plus Dragons & Seraphims), being 6-degrees-of-freedom 
(6DoF)-capable, ie capable of using reverse + side + up/down thrust.


Armor and damage types
----------------------
In general, Shivan strike crafts and capital ship boast special armor types that render them more resiliant
against Alliance ligh weapons - aside from the Kayser which has the Shivan Weapon damage type. Anti-capital
ship weapons, bar a few exceptions, still deal full damage to both Alliance & Shivan capital ships.
Warships take reduced damage from fighter-grade weapons, though Alliance hulls are more vulnerable to Shivan
weapons - especially fighters & bombers.

Ship variants
-------------
Some capital ships (particularily Shivan vessels) come up in different "variants" consisting of a modified
turret loadout, armor type, hit points, etc. Much like real-life warships, this means that certain ship types
can be used for different roles without the need to design and build a new specialized hull. For exemple,
the standard Rakshasa come with 4 SRed beams, while another variant trades two of these for a different weapon.
The *ship_variants* table in the *config/* folder lists the various varrying variants for each vessel (may 
contain mild spoilers).

New weapons
-----------
Both Alliance and Shivan arsenal have been expanded a bit:
  - There are now several Vasudan-exclusive weapons :
    * HM: High-kinetic fast-firing cycling weapon with good anti-shield capabilities, but low hull damage. Good energy efficiency.
    * Sehku: Slow-firing, medium-range anti-subsystem weapon with high shield damage. Surprisingly effective against Shivan fighters.
    * Sahr AS: Next-generation banshee, meant to compensate for the fact that Vasudan fighters can't mount the Kayser.
  - Alliance bombers, myrmidons, taurets and serapis have access to a pair of ammo-using primaries for heavy anti-fighter & anti-armor duty.
  - Alliance bombers and myrmidons are able to carry a short range swarmer bomb.
  - New GTVA capital ship weapons:
    * Wraith: Long range banshee variant, usually replace green blob turrets on older warships.
    * Mass Driver: Anti-hull weapon, provides additional anti-ship firepower.
    * Medium-grade direct fire beam weapons: Found on some of the supposedly newer warships.
    * Ship-to-ship torpedo systems.
    * [CLASSIFIED]
  - In the later stages of the campaign, Shivan vessels may carry upgraded versions of their standard primaries/blob turrets.
  - A corvette-grade direct fire beam is now mounted on Shivan corvettes and destroyers.
  - Shivan multi-shot turret: Fires in bursts, effective against bombers and big ships.
  - New Shivan strike craft & sentry gun weapons:
    * Sniper gun: Long range, high kinetic effect, low shield penetration.
    * Scatter gun & Light scatter gun: Close range, fast firing shotgun.
    * Heavy anticap laser: An offshoot of the upgraded mega laser, sometimes mounted on bombers & heavy fighters.
    * Large Cannon: Powerful anti-ship primary found exclusively on Taurvi bombers.
    * Flak Weapon: Mounted on Taurvis and Seraphims, fires multiple shots at once.
    * Swarmer bombs: Fired at long range, these are designed to saturate the target's point defences. Shameless down-graded rip-off of the super cool UEF Warhammer torpedo from Blue Planet.
  - Subspace Missile strikes:
    * Only starts appearing in the later parts of the campaign.
    * These can come in various forms: the traditional TAG strike, local SSMs, or dedicated spotter ships.
    * Alarm sounds will allow you to differenciate incoming non-local strikes.

New ships
---------
Most of the "new" GTVA warships are cutting/bleeding edge assets that are only beginning to enter active duty,
and hence are fairly rare.
* Vasudan capital ships:
  - GVC Mentu Enforcer: More fragile than a regular *Mentu*, it carries a powerful beam cannon.
  - GVC Newet: Has a terrifying array of anti-fighter weapons, but lack the anti-capital punch of the *Enforcer*
  - GVGb Hemsut: Torpedo gunboat.
  - GVCv Selket (asset status pending): Vasudan equivalent to the Sparta (see below), but closer to enter active duty.
* Vasudan fighters:
  - GVB Hathor: 6 DoF capable bomber, an improvement upon the *Sekhmet*.
  - GVF Nhu: A late-game Vasudan "counterpart" of the *Erinyes* and *Ares*. Small, tough and agile, it lacks the extra-guns firepower of its Terran brethren.
  - GVF Serapis Elite: 6 DoF capable variant of the *Serapis*, has more armor/shield, and a wider weapon compatibility.
* Terran capital ships:
  - GTGb Cretheus: Flak gunboat, has a pair of mass driver turrets for anti-ship duty.
  - GTCv Sparta: Powerful bleeding edge warship. Boasts formidable anti-capital firepower.
  - GTCv Stratos: Futur-tech post-Capella warship, status pending.
  - GTD Erebus: Futur-tech post-Capella warship, status pending.
* Shivan capital ships:
  - SGb Asura: Powerful, but fragile gunboat.
