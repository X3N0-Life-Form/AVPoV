A Vasudan Point of View
=======================
=======================

Freespace 2 modpack + campaign

Setting
=======
This is a Capella era campaign, whose events are somewhat parallel to the main Freespace 2 campaign.
You play as a Vasudan pilot fighting to contain the Shivan incursion in the nebula and Gamma Draconis.


Differences between AVPoV & FS2
===============================
There is a certain number of differences between the FS2 gameplay, and how things work in AVPoV.
As a result, the main campaign has received some minor edits to be more in line with the rest of AVPoV.

AI and improved Shivan agility
------------------------------
Like any modern mod, AVPoV takes advantage of FSO's improved AI features. In addition, Shivan fighters and
bombers have been altered to be able to glide (like in Vassago's Dirge), with FS2-era fighters - plus Dragons
& Seraphims, having 6 degrees of freedom (ie, reverse + side + up/down thrust).
